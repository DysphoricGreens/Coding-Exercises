# Coding-Exercises

I like to code, but I often forget that I am an amateur and start into huge projects that I don't have the experience for. My main language is JavaScript and this is the one that I want to learn more. With that I also want to learn front end and static websites so I thought Iâ€™d kill two birds with one stone. Interactive web exercises that show off my skills at that current time. If I learn anything new, past projects won't be updated due to this. I not only want this to be a way to mark my progress, but also a portfolio!
